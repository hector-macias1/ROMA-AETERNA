# ROMA-AETERNA

This is a very brief game targeted at kids who like history (roman history, to be precise). It is set during the late western Roman Empire, 
during 3 of the most significant battles that led to its fall.

This project was developed for a Java course, and it is based on the "Artifact" game developed by the magnificent [ForeignGuyMike]: https://github.com/foreignguymike
